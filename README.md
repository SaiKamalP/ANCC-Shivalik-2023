We have a ANCC Shivalik 2023 codeforces group where we share practice problem sheets.

In order to get access to those sheets you can do the following.

1. Make an account on [Codeforces](https://www.codeforces.com).
2. Click Join now on the following website and register with codeforces handel [cfstats-ancc](https://cfstats-ancc.infinityfreeapp.com/login)
3. Ask your hostel's ANCC representative to add you to your hostel group on [cfstats-ancc](https://cfstats-ancc.infinityfreeapp.com/login) website.
4. Fill out the following google form [spectator-entry-ANCC-Shivalik-2023](https://forms.gle/mcLkCk72H44CREdVA)

Once you have filled the form we will add you into the group as a spectator(you will get an invitation on codeforces).

As a spectator you will be able to see the practice sheets, solve them ...etc.

Only limitation as a spectator is that you will not be able to give the contest live, that is if we organize a contest from 8 pm to 10 pm on that day, You will be able to see the problems but you can't register to solve them. Once the contest completes you can see/solve/virtual participate ...etc.

Note: We don't want to impose any such limitations, we can't just find a way to make spectators also give live contest. We don't want to mix up every hostel into the group. All this is to just keep the things sorted.
